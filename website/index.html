Founded in 2011, the MIT Assistive Technology Club is a MIT student group that serves as the starting point for engaging with students, faculty, and staff about assistive technology (AT) for people with disabilities. We also welcome involvement from people with an interest in AT in the Boston area and beyond.

<a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/PPAT/fall2013/index.html">6.811: Principles and Practice of Assistive Technology</a>
<br>
Principles and Practice of Assistive Technology (PPAT) is an interdisciplinary 12-unit subject centered around a design project in which small teams of students work closely with a person with a disability in the Cambridge area to design a device, piece of equipment, app, or other solution that helps them live more independently. Over the course of the term, each team meets with its "client," iterates through multiple prototypes, and learns about the challenges and realities of designing technologies for people with disabilities. It is typically offered in the fall semester.
